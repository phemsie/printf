Description

This team project is part of the first year curriculum of ALX_Africa.

_printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

What you should learn from this project:

•	How to use git in a team setting

•	Applying variadic functions to a big project

•	The complexities of printf

•	Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

Prototype

•	int _printf(const char format, ...);

Usage

•	Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format

•	All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c

•	Returns the number of characters in the output string on success, -1 otherwise

•	Call it this way: _printf("format string", arguments...) where format string can contain conversion specifiers and flags, along with regular characters

Examples

•	_printf("Hello, Best School\n") prints "Hello, Best School", followed by a new line

•	_printf("%s", "Hello") prints "Hello"

•	_printf("This is a number: %d", 98) prints "This is a number: 98"
